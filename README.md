### Usage
- Put ADTs in `input` folder.
- Run tool.
- Get WDL from `output` folder.

### Version support
Input ADTs can probably be any version. 3.3.5 ADTs will spam the console with warnings but it should still work.

WDL is for Legion+ clients. 

### Credits
Luzifix for WDL MARE calculations, implave for testing.
